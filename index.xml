      <description>This Project is about using Macine learning to detect Alzeimer&amp;rsquo;s in early stages

      <description>My project is about the electricity production using diffrent sources. I splited the sources to two categories, clean and non clean. Clean sources are Hydroelectric Conventional, Nuclear, Pumped Storage, Solar, and Wind. The non clean sources are fossil fuels and materials that come from plants, municipal and industrial wastes.
The source of the datatset used is US Energy Information Administration www.eia.gov
 Imported 2 datasets, and cleaned them using Pandas Renamed the columns Merged them Replaced NaNs with zeros Built graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn    This Project&amp;rsquo;s GitHub Link</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, â€œHis eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>
